Once you clone your fork, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

## Contributing

Create a branch with your work. Make sure your branch is up to date with the develop branch on this repo! Your branch should be named using your initials and the feature you worked on. For example if I added more mental health resources to the API I would name my branch like this:

```
rc/addApiResources
```

Open a pull request to the develop branch and once reviewed if no changes are needed your code will be merged in!
